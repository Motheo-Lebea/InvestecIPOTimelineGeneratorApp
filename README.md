# InvestecIPOTimelineGeneratorApp
I invented a tool using Java that allows Investment Banking Analysts to easily and efficiently track key milestones in an IPO process. I named it using Investec because it is part of my portfolio and i always wanted to work at Investec.

In this tutorial, you will learn to create my IPO Timeline Generator with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library.

Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create my IPO Timeline Generator App. It's fairly simple, I'll create a Youtube video soon.

Step by step breakdown to effectively use my app:

1. I use IntelliJ CE, so please ensure that you have downloaded it, and make sure it's the community edition. To download it search JetBrains.com and select 'Developer Tools' in the top left hand corner of your browser/screen. Use this (https://youtu.be/zCkhAVhuILs?si=gUm2Qna0M92lC0zU) YouTube video to assist you.
2. Download Java 17. (java.sun.com)
3. Open a new project and only copy the files on the respository (only App.java and InvestecIPOTimelineGenerator.java).
