# InvestecIPOTimelineGeneratorApp
I invented a tool using Java that allows Investment Banking Analysts to easily and efficiently track key milestones in an IPO process. I named it using Investec because it is part of my portfolio and i always wanted to work at Investec.

In this tutorial, you will learn to create my IPO Timeline Generator with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library.

Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create my IPO Timeline Generator App. It's fairly simple, I'll create a Youtube video soon.
